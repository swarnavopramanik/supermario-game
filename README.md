## History

       Few video games can claim the distinction of being in the general consciousness for decades, spanning different generations. Super Mario (ðŸ”Ž 
       wiki) is one of, if not the only one, that has made great strides in this area.

     There's almost no one on the planet who has not heard of the Italian plumber in overalls who goes by the name of Mario. Those who have never 
     Splayed the game may not be aware of his humble beginnings but they have in some shape or form, heard of him.
